# Project 7: Statistical Analysis of Product Length Variation Using Minitab
## ðŸ§¾ **Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing the variation of product length data collected from a manufacturing process. Using Minitab software, statistical tools such as control charts and capability analysis are applied to evaluate the process stability and capability in meeting dimensional specifications.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To assess the process stability and capability of product length measurements by applying statistical analysis tools (Xbarâ€“S chart, Cp, and Cpk) in Minitab, thereby determining whether the process meets the required tolerance limits.
